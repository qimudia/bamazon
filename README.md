I created a front-end shopping center using HTML, CSS, and JavScript/jQuery to provide the customer with a listing of products available to purchase. 

Customers are able to enter specific quantity, and then submit their order.

Nothing is happening yet when they click the submit button
I calculated the total but couldn't get the function to work

I validated the form also but it is not displaying yet..

I will love to try work on it some more to get those functionalities working if given the opportunity...
